# TransferFinderFiles
AppleScript to move files from one folder to another.

Seemingly simple, this task sees a lot of variation in the AppleScript world. The common solution of looping through the files is slow and wasteful.

This script attempts to streamline the speed, ease of use and possibly the complexity of the task.

Additionally, this is intended to be the base of a random number of random files transfered from one folder to another.
